A unique alternative to water baths
Unlike water, Lab Armor Beads do not evaporate and therefore help protect against instrument overheating and burnout. But, like water, it is important to add a sufficient volume to the bath to ensure safe operation. An insufficient volume can cause inaccurate thermostat readings, which can result in continuous heating of the bath. Beads can be used in water baths or dry baths. Plus, they can replace ice in the lab when used in our Chill Bucket.
Stay dry and protected from waterborne microbial contaminants
Hold capped and non-watertight vessels in place without racks or accessories
Use less energy than water
Don't require germicides
Eliminate warm-up time and make lab experiments easy and repeatable
Made from recyclable material
For best results, fill bath between 75% and full. Use a minimum of 12.3L of beads per 1000 sq. in. of bath.","https://assets.fishersci.com/TFS-Assets/CCG/product-images/F204644~p.eps-650.jpg","Lab Armor™ Chill Bucket™ Bag Kit Accessories: Chill Packs™","https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/lab-armor-chill-bucket-bag-kit-accessories-chill-packs/10876023#?keyword=","Description

Thermo Scientific™ A10 refrigerated bath circulators provide efficient cooling for open and closed applications, with temperatures ranging from −10° to +100°C and maximum bath volume of 6 liters. Powerful bath circulators with a stainless-steel reservoir can be configured with the controller that best meets circulation and temperature ranges for your application.
Drain port at the front for operator convenience.
Advanced design allows two sides of the unit to be blocked, allowing placement in a
corner while maintaining full refrigeration performance.
For less demanding applications, power consumptions can be lowered by utilizing
the energy savings mode.
The controller can be indexed 90° for easier viewing
Outstanding cooling power
Expansive temperature ranges
Powerful force/suction pumps
Six controller options
