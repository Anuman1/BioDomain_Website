But, like water, it is important to add a sufficient volume to the bath to ensure safe operation. An insufficient volume can cause inaccurate thermostat readings, which can result in continuous heating of the bath. Beads can be used in water baths or dry baths. Plus, they can replace ice in the lab when used in our Chill Bucket.\nStay dry and protected from waterborne microbial contaminants\nHold capped and non-watertight vessels in place without racks or accessories\nUse less energy than water\nDon't require germicides\nEliminate warm-up time and make lab experiments easy and repeatable\nMade from recyclable material\nFor best results, fill bath between 75% and full. Use a minimum of 12.3L of beads per 1000 sq. in. of bath.",
